vimconfig
=========

Place the files in the home\_folder directory at the root of your home folder.

On Windows, if an environmental variable named HOME exists, this will be used. Otherwise, check the contents of the USERPROFILE environmental variable with echo %USERPROFILE% to find your default home directory.

The \_vimrc files should be renamed .vimrc on Mac or Linux. It should exist at the root of your home folder.

After installing the config, you will need to install the the Envy Code R font (from http://damieng.com/creative/typography).

Finally, after starting gVIM for the first time, execute BundleInstall to download and install all of the plugins.
